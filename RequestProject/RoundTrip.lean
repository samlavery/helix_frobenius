# Unconditional faithfulness via the loss-ledger / reconstruction-bijection method

A point of a 3D conical-helix ("harmonic fiber") is projected to a 2D unit circle and then to a
1D line. The **projection itself is lossy**: phase and radial information are genuinely destroyed.
The method recorded here is the **loss-ledger / reconstruction-bijection** method:

> keep a *ledger* of exactly the channels the projection destroys; then the map
> `fiber ↦ (retained channel, loss ledger)` is a **bijection**, so the original fiber can be
> reconstructed exactly. No information is truly lost once it is booked in the ledger.

The whole development is **faithful** (the reconstruction is an exact two-sided inverse) and
**unconditional** (no hypotheses, only the standard Lean/Mathlib axioms).

## The channels

A harmonic fiber is recorded in the **cylindrical coordinate system** `(radial r, phase θ, height z)`.
That is only the coordinate *system*; the *shape* traced is a genuine **cone**, characterised by
`r = coneSlope · z` (the radius grows with the height) — emphatically **not** a cylinder, whose
radius would be constant.

* **height** — the *retained* channel (`project`).
* **(radial, phase)** — the *lost* channels, booked in the `ledger`.

The conical helix **grows up and out**: the height climbs at a constant unit **pitch** while the
radius opens out at the constant rate `coneSlope` (a *separate* constant), and the phase carries the
`π/3` shift, so `coneFiber t = (coneSlope · t, t + π/3, t)`. It lies on the cone `r = coneSlope · z`
(`coneFiber_on_cone`), equivalently on the Cartesian cone `x² + y² = (coneSlope · z)²`
(`realize_coneFiber_on_cone`), and its radius is strictly increasing
(`coneFiber_radius_strictMono`) — the defining "up and out" growth of a cone rather than the
constant radius of a cylinder.

## The reconstruction bijection (the core result)

`record f = (project f, ledger f)` and `reconstruct d` invert each other:

* `reconstructionBijection : Fiber ≃ ℝ × (ℝ × ℝ)` — the explicit bijection.
* `reconstruct_record`, `record_injective`, `record_bijective` — faithfulness, unconditionally.

## Why the ledger is necessary (the loss ledger is accurate)

The purely geometric projection `geomProj` (realize on the unit circle, keep height, *drop the
ledger*) is provably **not injective**:

* `phase_lost`  — `2π`-periodicity collapses distinct phases;
* `radial_lost` — dropping the radius collapses distinct radii.

So without the ledger the data is destroyed; *with* it, reconstruction is bijective. That contrast
is the whole point.

## The 2D and 1D stages

* The projected atom lands on the unit circle: `projAtom_on_unit_circle`, `unitCircleProj_on_circle`.
* The 2D→1D projection "is literally the log": on the positive height encoding `exp h`, `Real.log`
  recovers `h` (`log_recovers_height`) and is injective there (`lineProj_faithful`). The end-to-end
  pipeline `pipeline t = t` (`pipeline_id`) is a bijection (`pipeline_bijective`).

## Coordinate shifts and rescalings preserve information

A shift `x ↦ x + c` and a nonzero rescaling `x ↦ k·x` (and more generally any affine
`x ↦ k·x + c`) are **bijections** of `ℝ` (`shift_bijective`, `rescale_bijective`,
`affineCoord_bijective`, with the explicit inverse `affineCoordEquiv`): they neither lose nor gain
information. In particular the midpoint rescaling `halve = (·)/2` identifies the pairs
`(1, 1/2)`, `(π/3, π/6)` and `(log 7, log 7 / 2)` — from the geometric-projection perspective these
are **the same value** (`same_value_under_halve`, `halve_bijective`).

## Honest scope note (no Riemann Hypothesis is proved)

The "critical line at `1/2`" enters only as the literal numeric midpoint of the height
parametrisation (`midpoint_to_critical`: helix midpoint → circle midpoint → `1/2`). It is a
statement about coordinates and information flow and carries **no** number-theoretic content; it
does **not** prove or bear on the Riemann Hypothesis.

/-! ## Data processing inequality: "offline zeros" as a DPI violation

This section formalizes the *logical / information-flow skeleton* of the requested argument. Treat
the 3D helix as a **source** `S` and the 1D frame as a **derived** space `D`, related by a
deterministic **processing** map `derive : S → D`. This is the Hilbert–Pólya hypothesis taken as an
*explicit hypothesis*: the 1D spectrum is **computed from** the source, exactly as the requester
puts it that "zeta zeros are nothing but derived values, computed using the primes as source data."

The **data processing inequality**, in this deterministic setting, says processing can only
**destroy or preserve** information, never **create** it. The genuine features visible downstream
are *exactly* the image of the source under `derive`; nothing outside that image is real. An
**offline zero** is a putative 1D feature with **no source preimage** — information that appeared
*after* processing. Asserting it is genuine contradicts the DPI.

### Honest scope note
These are abstract theorems about functions and information flow. They do **not** prove the Riemann
Hypothesis, do **not** establish that the 3D helix is in fact the source of the zeta zeros (that
identification is an unproven hypothesis, supplied here as an explicit hypothesis wherever it is
used), and do **not** decide whether offline zeros exist for ζ. They formalize *only* the
conditional logic: **if** the 1D frame is a deterministic image of the source, **then** features
absent from the source cannot be genuine downstream. The closing meta-results make precise the
requester's two asymmetric points: an internal (1D-only) method *cannot* settle offline-ness, while
lifting to a richer frame *can* — just as FLT was settled by lifting to elliptic curves, so one
cannot declare a priori that no analogous lift exists for RH.

(`id`) and offline under another (a constant map). Hence a purely 1D-internal analytic method
cannot, in principle, certify that offline zeros do or do not exist — "it is impossible to prove

/-! ## Hilbert–Pólya / Von Neumann: a realised spectral program *discharges* the DPI hypothesis

The previous section took the Hilbert–Pólya identification ("the 1D spectrum is a deterministic
image of the source") as an **explicit hypothesis** `hHP`. As the requester notes, a *full*
Hilbert–Pólya construction — a **self-adjoint (symmetric) operator** `T` whose **spectral harmonics**
(its eigenvalues `μ`, the *poles* of the resolvent) parametrise the zeros via `s = 1/2 + iμ` — would
"sock in" and **discharge** that hypothesis, turning `hHP` from an assumption into a *theorem*.

Two ingredients make this precise here, both **unconditional** given the operator:

* **Von Neumann reality of the spectrum.** Eigenvalues of a symmetric operator are real
  (`symmetric_eigenvalue_real`, from `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.conj_eigenvalue_eq_self`). Hence the
  spectral parametrisation `spectralZero μ = 1/2 + iμ` lands **exactly on the critical line**
  `Re = 1/2` (`hilbert_polya_on_critical_line`). This is the geometric "retains height" statement at
  the spectral level: the **imaginary** ordinate is the eigenvalue itself
  (`spectralZero_im`), while the **Pythagorean** law `|s|² = (1/2)² + μ²`
  (`spectralZero_pythagoras`) fixes the real part to the midpoint `1/2`.
* **Discharge of the DPI hypothesis.** If the genuine zeros are *exactly* the image of the
  eigenvalue source under `spectralZero` (the content of a realised Hilbert–Pólya program), then
  `hHP : genuine ⊆ passedDown derive` holds **by construction** (`hp_realised_gives_hHP`), so by
  `offline_zero_violates_dpi` **no offline zero can exist** (`hp_no_offline_zeros`). The capstone
  `hilbert_polya_capstone` packages both consequences from a single symmetric operator.

### Honest scope note
This remains **conditional on the existence** of such a self-adjoint operator with the required
spectrum — the Hilbert–Pólya program itself is open, and nothing here proves the Riemann Hypothesis.
What *is* proved unconditionally is the **implication**: *given* the operator and the spectral
identification of the zeros, the eigenvalues are real (Von Neumann), the zeros lie on `Re = 1/2`, and
the earlier DPI hypothesis is discharged so offline zeros are impossible. -/

/-- **Capstone: a single symmetric operator discharges everything.** From a self-adjoint operator
`T`, an eigenvalue source `toEig` landing in its spectrum, and the realised identification of the
genuine zeros with the spectral image, one obtains *simultaneously*:

1. **Critical line** (Von Neumann): every genuine zero has real part `1/2`; and
2. **No offline zeros** (DPI discharged): no genuine zero lacks an eigenvalue preimage.

This is the precise sense in which a full Hilbert–Pólya construction "socks in and discharges" the
hypothesis taken explicitly in the data-processing section. It is the implication only — it does not
prove that such an operator exists, and hence does not prove the Riemann Hypothesis. -/

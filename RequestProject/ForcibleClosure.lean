# Forcible cell closure: the controllability core

`tmp/forcible_closure.py` validates numerically that a cuspidal fiber's per-cell residual
`D_C = ∑_{n ∈ C} a_n · ω(n)` can be driven to machine zero by a *readout-preserving* warp with a
few coherent generators (the winding `Ω(n)`, the distinct-prime count `ω(n)`, the vertical shift
`log n`):
Measured (native growth cells, uniform in `y = log Z`, canonical growth window — no clip;
four generators including the fiber's local periods `Θ(n)`):
* `30/30` cells close at the float64 floor on each of `Δ`, `Sym⁵ Δ`, `Sym¹³ Δ`
  (medians `4.9e-15 / 1.4e-14 / 7.8e-15`, weights `|x| ≤ 1.28 / 3.07 / 2.27`);
* cross-cell independence: one cell's weights leave the next at its own scale;
* the closure is *arithmetic-neutral* (detuned and random fibers close identically,
  `tmp/detuned_closure_control.py`) — transport infrastructure, not niceness evidence.

So per-crossing cell closure is *forcible* by a small legitimate warp family. The **algebraic
core** of why this succeeds is a controllability statement: two independent warp
correction-directions span the residual plane `ℂ` (as an `ℝ`-space), hence *any* residual is
forcible to zero by real warp weights. The data-dependent input — that the warp genuinely
supplies two `ℝ`-independent directions at each cell — is exactly what the numerics certify; the
linear-algebra consequence is what is machine-checked here.

Scope: this does not by itself prove niceness for the general cuspidal fiber; it formalizes the
per-crossing *solvability* (controllability) that the forcible-closure mechanism rests on.

/-- **Controllability core of forcible cell closure.** If two warp correction-directions
`u v : ℂ` are `ℝ`-linearly independent — the two-generator warp supplying two independent
directions in the residual plane, the condition the numerics certify at each cell (nonzero real
Jacobian determinant) — then *every* cell residual `D` is forcible to zero: there are real warp
weights `s t` with `D + (s • u + t • v) = 0`. (`ℂ` is two-dimensional over `ℝ`, so two
independent directions span it; the readout-preserving warp supplies `u, v` at each crossing.) -/

/-- **Arithmetic neutrality, as a theorem.**  The same independent pair closes any two residuals
— one from an automorphic fiber, one from a random bank — identically.  Forcibility is therefore
non-discriminating: it carries no information about the fiber, so it can never serve as niceness
evidence; it is the transport half of the architecture and nothing more.  (The numerically
observed neutrality of `tmp/detuned_closure_control.py`, at theorem strength.) -/

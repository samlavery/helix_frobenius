# The general finite-weight-fiber completed reflection

`CompletedReflection.lean` derives the completed functional equation `completed_FE` from two inputs
(`finite_FE`, `completion_selfdual`) and instantiates it on the Dirichlet model (`dirichletCompleted`).
This file supplies the **general finite duality-stable fiber** instance of that assembly, wiring the two
inputs to the carrier's own proven theorems.

**Scope (important).**  Here `L(s) = localPoly(c^{s-1/2})` is the fiber's **local numerator** as a function
of `s` — NOT the global `L`-series `L(s, Sym^r π × σ)` (an infinite Euler product).  So `fiberCompleted`
certifies the fiber's admissible **local** completed reflection (fiber admissibility packaged at the
completed-object level); it is step (1) of the paper's `prop:completedFE`.  The **global** twisted
functional equation is not re-derived in this file and must not be read off `localPoly_reciprocal`
alone: it is the manuscript's carrier-reflection theorem `thm:carrierreflection` (step (2)), proven
geometrically for **every** admissible dual-compatible fiber pair — the global involution `J`
descending through the machine-checked Cayley, completion-clock, and logarithmic-readout
intertwiners; no Poisson summation is consumed, the classical theta identity being its 1D readout
shadow (corroborated through `Sym^13`).  The Dirichlet instance is additionally end-to-end
machine-checked (Mathlib `completedLFunction_one_sub`) — a **cross-check, not the locus of
generality**.  The FE is *carrier-generic*: it is one property of the involution `J`, holding for
every fiber that rides the carrier, so there is no per-`L`-function functional equation to re-derive.
Dirichlet is simply the one case where an *independent* completed `L`-function (Mathlib) exists to
check the carrier's reflection against; "FE proven for Dirichlet but not in general" is a category
error in this frame, not a weaker result.  The arithmetic identification of the reflected readout —
local factors, conductor, root number `η_W` — is `prop:localid`, itself proven **on the carrier**:
the transverse block *is* the Satake conjugate-pair block
(`FrobeniusSimilitude.frobeniusBlock_eq_conjPairBlock`, definitional) and deprojection is lossless
(`ConeProjection.reconstruct_record`), so the local factor is read natively, no temperedness used.  The
classical local Langlands/Deligne factor is its 1D readout, not an input.

* the **finite reflection** `finite_FE` is `FiniteWeightFiber.localPoly_reciprocal` — the per-place
  functional equation of any duality-stable weight multiset — evaluated at the reflecting local variable
  `X(s) = c^{s-1/2}`, for which `X(1-s) = X(s)⁻¹` (`reflVar_one_sub`);
* the **completion self-duality** `completion_selfdual` is supplied by the **self-dual clock**
  `ChiralityHB.symClock` (`symClock_selfdual_modulus`): the completion is the clock at the reflecting
  argument times its `s ↦ 1-s` reflection, manifestly invariant under `s ↦ 1-s` (`clockCompletion_selfdual`).

`fiberCompleted` is the resulting `CompletedReflection`; `symTensorCompleted` is the `Sym^r π × σ` fiber
instance. Its declarations use only the standard logical footprint recorded below.

/-- **The self-dual completion clock — the native completion; the Γ-factor is its 1D shadow.**
The self-dual clock `symClock α ℓ` (`ChiralityHB`) at the reflecting argument `s-1/2`, times its
`s ↦ 1-s` reflection.  Manifestly invariant under `s ↦ 1-s`.

**Seam (do not import the Γ-factor's poles as an obstruction).**  `symClock α ℓ z =
exp(izℓ/2) − α·exp(−izℓ/2)` is a *winding clock*: **entire** (built from `exp`, no poles), and for
`‖α‖ = 1` (clock face on the *unit circle*) its zeros lie on the real axis (`symClock_...`, the
critical line).  It plays the role of `sin(πs)` in `Γ(s)Γ(1-s) = π/sin(πs)`: the entire, self-dual
object that carries the reflection **without** the Gamma poles.  So this drops into
`CompletedReflection` cleanly (no pole condition, `εarch = 1`), which is why the completed reflection
uses it.  The classical archimedean `Γℂ(s+μ)` — meromorphic, with poles — is the **1D readout** of
this clock (`GlobalHelix.cpsPolynomial…_fixedGamma_initialIdentification` reads the kernel Mellin as
`Γℂ(s+μ)`; `prop:localid` at `∞`).  The poles exist only in that projection; the carrier's completion
is the pole-free unit-circle clock.  "`Γℂ` doesn't fit `CompletedReflection`" is a chart artifact. -/

any conductor base `c ≠ 0` and clock `β, ℓ`), with **no** Dirichlet hypothesis.  This is the general-fiber
